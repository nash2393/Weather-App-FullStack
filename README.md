# Weather Dashboard

## Overview

The Weather Dashboard is a simple yet powerful web application designed to provide real-time weather information for any location by utilizing latitude and longitude coordinates. It fetches data directly from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in an easy-to-understand format. This project showcases the use of JavaScript, Node.js with Express, and EJS templates to deliver a responsive and intuitive user interface. All client-side assets, including stylesheets, images, and JavaScript files, are hosted locally to ensure fast loading times and a seamless user experience.
